A few words on the status of protocol support..

*** ARP
Limited: we never make ARP requests, and only populate our ARP cache
from requests we receive.

** IPv4
Handles multiple interfaces.
Does routing.
Lacks fragmentation, and much else.

** ICMP
Limited: just responds to pings.

** UDP
Has a basic programming interface to register packet-handling functions.
Does not send ICMP port-unreachable replies.

*** TCP
Basic state machine, data acknowledgement, and reading.
No proper programming interface.
No timers or loss-handling logic.
